# data-sci-neural-network

Hello, 

This repository is for resume purposes. This is to display my previous work in the domain of data science via my previous courses. Please feel free to reach out if you'd like to discuss any of these files/ideas. The html and pdf files are for ease of view in what i've done if you do not have easy access to a virtual environment like jupyter notebook or google colab that can run python notebook files.

My goal for this is to construct a model that can take a certain set of features related to the Titanic and predict whether a
person survived or not (0 or 1). Since we're trying to predict a binary categorical variable (1 or 0), logistic regression seems like a
good place to start from.
The dataset that I'll be using for this task comes from kaggle.com and contains the following attributes:


PassengerId
Survived (0 or 1)
Pclass: Ticket class (1, 2, or 3 where 3 is the lowest class)
Name
Sex
Age: Age in years
SibSp: # of siblings / spouses aboard the Titanic
Parch: # of parents / children aboard the Titanic
Ticket: Ticket number
Fare: Passenger fare
Cabin: Cabin number
Embarked: Port of Embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton)
